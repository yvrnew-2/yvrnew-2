- **Progressive Improvement**: Each iteration builds on previous results
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics (mAP50, mAP95, Precision, Recall)
- **Model Versioning**: Track and compare different model versions

### 3. **Human-in-the-Loop Interface**
- **Smart Review System**: Focus on high-uncertainty samples first
- **Quick Actions**: Accept, correct, or reject predictions with one click
- **Visual Feedback**: Uncertainty scores and confidence ranges
- **Progress Tracking**: See how your reviews improve the model

### 4. **Production-Ready Models**
- **Export Functionality**: Get trained models ready for deployment
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed accuracy and speed benchmarks
- **Model Optimization**: CPU/GPU compatible YOLO models
- **Easy Integration**: Drop-in replacement for existing workflows

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Create a Training Session

```bash
# Navigate to Active Learning dashboard
http://localhost:3000/active-learning

# Click "New Training Session"
# Configure your training parameters:
- Session Name: "Industrial Defect Detection v1"
- Dataset: Select your labeled dataset
- Epochs: 50 (recommended)
- Batch Size: 16 (adjust based on GPU memory)
- Learning Rate: 0.001 (default works well)
- Max Iterations: 10 (stop after 10 cycles)
```

### 2. Start First Iteration

```bash
# Click "Start First Iteration"
# The system will:
1. Prepare training dataset (80/20 train/val split)
2. Train YOLO model on labeled data
3. Generate uncertainty scores for unlabeled images
4. Present top uncertain samples for review
```

### 3. Review Uncertain Samples

```bash
# For each uncertain sample:
‚úÖ Accept Prediction - Model is correct
‚úèÔ∏è Accept with Corrections - Mostly correct, minor fixes needed
‚ùå Reject Prediction - Model is wrong

# Focus on highest uncertainty scores first
# Your reviews directly improve the next iteration
```

### 4. Continue Iterations

```bash
# After reviewing samples:
1. Click "Start Next Iteration"
2. Model retrains with your feedback
3. Performance typically improves each cycle
4. Stop when satisfied with accuracy
```

### 5. Export Trained Model

```bash
# When training is complete:
1. Click "Export Best Model"
2. Get model path and performance metrics
3. Use in production auto-labeling
```

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Model Accuracy
- **mAP50**: Mean Average Precision at IoU 0.5
- **mAP95**: Mean Average Precision at IoU 0.5-0.95
- **Precision**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
- **Recall**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

### Uncertainty Metrics
- **Uncertainty Score**: 1 - max_confidence (higher = more uncertain)
- **Confidence Variance**: Spread of confidence scores
- **Entropy Score**: Information theory measure of uncertainty
- **Combined Score**: Weighted average of all uncertainty metrics
